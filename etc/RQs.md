Broad question: What factors influence the perceived benefits and costs of learning to program among individuals and fields that traditionally do not engage in computational methods?

    Is having early programming experience (writing your first line of code before the of age eighteen) associated with positive feelings toward programming later on?

    For a similar developer profile (years of experience programming, writing your first line of code), does gender influence enthusiasm towards the open-source software movement?

    To what degree are demographics, academic background, and social networks associated with the perceived costs of learning to program (e.g. feeling that you are on your own, that you spend too much time coding instead of doing other work, or that your coding skills are not valued as much as other types of knowledge)?y
